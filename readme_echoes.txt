1. Description
This is a full port/conversion of Echoes (Half-Life mod) to sven coop. After playing 
this awesome mod i started to make a port of it to be added to my server but shortly 
i stopped working on it. Months later, after closing my servers i decided to resume the 
work and finish this, as a challenge. I aim to add as much of the content of the 
original mod as possible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Important Notes 
echoes-6 may take a long while to load but it works, it is not a bug.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Changes made from the original mod
Some models and sounds were not included yet. I may add them in the future.
Some effects are missing or not fully implemented (custom env_shooter, custom env_sound)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Known issues 
-low fps in some maps: i did plenty to optimize the map, even if there is some stuff
that can be improved a bit the main problem is wpoly rising to very high values, i 
cannot do anything about that.
-echoes-5: in battle otis vs. bullsquid the bullsquid always win. This is because
if otis wins he gets bugged and stays still, i could not solve it yet.
-echoes-10: the scientist does not open the door for bonus goods, i could not find
why the scientist is not detected by the trigger. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Bug Reporting

It would help me if you find a problem and you report it to me but please check you
are reporting a REAL problem. Avoid making reports based only on resguy/w00tguy repacker 
script. I notice some people are making this kind of reports without caring about real 
issues and i am starting to believe they are just trolling.
Also, consider that sometimes bugs are caused by plugins active in the server host.

6. Download site

https://github.com/kmkz272/
https://gamebanana.com/mods/496418

I am using github and gamebanana to store my Sven Co-op ports and scripts since they 
are far better than scmapdb, and so i am not using it anymore. This site has has been
going downhill in the last years and is not a safe place for mappers to upload their 
maps since the management is out of control and doing whatever they want with the maps 
stored there. Please, do not upload this to scmapdb. If someone can get the download 
links of my ports in scmapdb deleted it would be great. They are causing confusion
by maintaining outdated or poorly edited alternative versions. I recommend to avoid
them.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Supported external plugins and scripts 

Survival

I do not support survival mode, i am not interested. Over the years there have been 
many signs from the devs that they are not willing to give proper maintenance to this feature.

9. Scmapdb

A longer, detailed explanation about my experience on scmapdb and my final decision 
of not using this site anymore:

Some time after the upload of the SHL i decided to seek help for map testing cooperation 
around the community. I contacted a group of users, they later became the active part of the 
management of scmapdb. They gave me some useful feedback, but also i rejected some ridiculous 
ideas. Some i still remember:
- Suggest me replace models in the echoes port with default ones to reduce filesize. This will break 
  sequences, and back then sound files had the bulk of the filesize.
- Questioning about why i uploaded a unrelated anime girl image to the Peaces Like Us page, 
  when this is the main image of the mod. (If you do not know the mod you should remain silent.)
- Using a W00tguy repacker report full with false positives to say that sweet half life port
  has bugs and imply that i am refusing to fix them.
- Telling me that is wrong in sweet half life port that npc calls you gordon because you 
  are not gordon when the main character of the mod is named Gordon McGinley.
- They wanted to merge the pages of my version of Residual life and the Cadaver one, making my version
  an update of the other which is wrong because they are independent projects.
As time advanced they pushed harder to make me apply the ideas i rejected, so there was a 
build up of annoyances. Also, at that point, they were replacing many maps on the site with 
edited versions, with unknown changes. Their words and behavior showed that they wanted to modify 
at their will other people projects, in a misguided intention to support the community. This and 
edits on Theunicgold maps agains his will, that were done disrepecfully, alerted me (also check W00tguy 
reply in SA13 map page). I did not expected them to target me early but it finally happened, and things 
escalated quickly, i was fed up with them trying to push bad changes into my projects and in 2021 i took 
distance from them and left an aggresive message in the echoes page, to make them stop. Since then, they
made from time to time some false reports about my projects like the flagrant one of absolute redemption 
in their discord server or the false crash report on echoes-6 (they cannot tell the difference between a
hang and long map loading time). finally, i year ago, i attempted to delete my ports from the site but a 
manager of the site reuploaded them again and locked me out from editing the page. And then i moved my 
projects to Github and gamebanana.

While i am thankful for the many years of free map hosting that scmapdb gave to the sven coop 
community this does not mean they are free to abuse the power of being the main site to share SC maps.

On many maps you cannot tell anymore if they have been edited by the managers or is an official version,
with the risk of losing the original files or being forced to play the maps the way they want. 
Also, the modifications made over them are often mislabeled, like a "fix", "remaster", "repack" while
being something different, like a custom edit. This shady behavior looks like they are lying to 
the community to give more legitimacy to their actions. 
There is no order or clear rules. so, where is the limit? there is one?

The site managers should be limited to protect the content and give a safe enviroment to share the
maps, they have no authority to take control of maps/ports and do changes against the will of 
their project leaders, else they should give a warning that when you upload a map to the site
is not your mapping project anymore but theirs. This go against the free modding spirit of goldsource.

About their attemps to mess with my projects:

-Garompa fake fix

The user Garompa uploaded a fake fixed version of echoes and made unnecessary, 
unautorised changes to the page in the scmapdb site. I reverted the changes and told him
to not do vandalism there. 

The details of the fake fix changes:

he added these 7 files:
player/playersounds/alyx_gordon01.wav
player/playersounds/alyx_hurt04.wav
player/playersounds/alyx_hurt05.wav
player/playersounds/alyx_hurt06.wav
player/playersounds/alyx_ohgod01.wav
player/playersounds/alyx_uggh01.wav
player/playersounds/alyx_uggh02.wav

he deleted these 2 files: 
weapons/xbow_reload1.ogg
barney/period.ogg

He added the .res changes.
He deleted the original author credits files.
He deleted and transfered to the echoes page the contents of my own credits file.
he did not modify any .bsp

about the Alyx sounds these are not used in the game. The Alyx model is used in echoes-14
(or former echoes24) and some unused sequences use these sounds. So they are not needed.
the xbow_reload1 is a extra file and it is ok to delete it. still, is worth saying that
an extra file will not affect your game.
The barney sound is an duplicate file i added for convenience of mine. Deleting it will
not make a difference.

We can notice that these changes are made by poor, lazy use of resguy/W00tguy repacker 
script where he did not verify if there was a real problem.

In case it is not clear enough i will make a list of what is wrong here:
- he uploaded a "fixed version" without asking me about it, knowing i am an active user.
- he deleted credits files. This is the most basic thing you should not do.
- poor work using the w00tguy repacker script. 
- his "fixed version" does not solve any real problem. So, it is fake.
- he Uploaded a fake fixed version, treating mine as an inferior one, implying my version
has problems he solved.
- they attempted to force me to accept the fake fix.
- he is hiding the changes, not telling what are the bugs "fixed". 
- at no point they asked, or cared about why i did not wanted the "fixed version". 

-Garompa/Tunak repack

There is a newer one, "scmapdb repack version", is worthless as well. There is no explanation 
about what he changed but as far as i have seen he just edited the Alyx model and deleted 
the sounds paths from the model plus innecessary file changes like the explaned above.
So this repack is a useless edit that does not give anything good to the player,
just used to make a false claim that he "fixed" something.
