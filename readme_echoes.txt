1. Why/description
This is a full port/conversion of Echoes (Half-Life mod) to sven coop. After playing 
this awesome mod i started to make a port of it to be added to my server but shortly 
i stop working on it. Months later, after closing my servers i decided to resume the 
work and finish this, as a challenge. I aim to add as most of the content of the 
original mod as possible. You are free to report bugs or suggest changes if you want 
but bear in mind i am using months of my free time to do this as a hobby and for the 
challenge, not to satisfy the whims of users and server owners. Please avoid making
reports based only on a bspguy report, make sure there is a REAL problem.

2. Important Notes 
echoes-6 may take a long while to load but it works, it is not a bug.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Changes made from the original mod
Some models and sounds were not included yet. I may add them in the future.
Some effects are missing or not fully implemented (custom env_shooter, custom env_sound)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Known issues 
-low fps in some maps: i did plenty to optimize the map, even if there is some stuff
that can be improved a bit the main problem is wpoly rising to very high values, i 
cannot do anything about that.
-echoes-5: in battle otis vs. bullsquid the bullsquid always win. This is because
if otis wins he gets bugged and stays still, i could not solve it yet.
-echoes-10: the scientist does not open the door for bonus goods, i could not find
why the scientist is not detected by the trigger. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Quality Standars

I try to have the maps series without bugs and i have been maintaining and improving 
them in the last 6 years but is no easy task. Worth saying that most of the
ports i played (before 2019) had serious bugs and no one cares about it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Bug Reporting

It would help me if you find a problem and you report it to me but please check you
are reporting a REAL problem. I have been active on scmapdb and discord for long time,
i will read messages sent to me but i may not answer because i am tired of the bad side
of the community. Avoid making reports based only on resguy/w00tguy repacker script.
I check it frequently enough so i am sure the bug reports generated by these tools will
not be a problem. I notice some people are making this kind of reports without caring 
about real issues and i am starting to believe they are just trolling.

7. Download site

https://github.com/kmkz272/
https://gamebanana.com/mods/496418

I am using github and gamebanana to store my Sven Co-op ports and scripts since they 
are far better than scmapdb, and so i am not using it anymore. This site has has been
going downhill in the last years and is not a safe place for mappers to upload their 
maps since the management is out of control and doing whatever they want with the maps 
stored there. Please, do not upload this to scmapdb.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Survival

I do not support survival mode, i am not interested. Over the years there have been 
many signs from the devs that they are not willing to properly maintain this feature.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Garompa repack

This has uploaded to scmapdb.

About this one, "garompa repack version", is worthless and outdated. There is no 
explanation about what he changed but as far as i have seen he just edited the Alyx 
model and deleted the sounds paths from the model plus innecessary file changes.
