1. Why/description
This is a full port/conversion of Echoes (Half-Life mod) to sven coop. After playing 
this awesome mod i started to make a port of it to be added to my server but shortly 
i stop working on it. Months later, after closing my servers i decided to resume the 
work and finish this, as a challenge. I aim to add as most of the content of the 
original mod as possible. You are free to report bugs or suggest changes if you want 
but bear in mind i am using months of my free time to do this as a hobby and for the 
challenge, not to satisfy the whims of users and server owners. Please avoid making
reports based only on a bspguy report, make sure there is a REAL problem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Important Notes 
echoes-6 may take a long while to load but it works, it is not a bug.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Changes made from the original mod
Some models and sounds were not included yet. I may add them in the future.
Some effects are missing or not fully implemented (custom env_shooter, custom env_sound)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Known issues 
-low fps in some maps: i did plenty to optimize the map, even if there is some stuff
that can be improved a bit the main problem is wpoly rising to very high values, i 
cannot do anything about that.
-echoes-5: in battle otis vs. bullsquid the bullsquid always win. This is because
if otis wins he gets bugged and stays still, i could not solve it yet.
-echoes-10: the scientist does not open the door for bonus goods, i could not find
why the scientist is not detected by the trigger. 
The water pool on the floor looks like stuttering. This happen after merging the maps,
i tried to solved this but so far nothing worked.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Quality Standars

I try to have the maps series without bugs and i have been maintaining and improving 
them in the last 4 years but is no easy task, the maps are made in a different engine
(spirit of half life) and they are full of details. Unlike other people i do not have
a public server or a team to make a test so i have to do that alone. this mean that 
i may miss problems that can only be seen when 2 or more players play the maps, now i
added bots in my tests and i hope to improve the results. Worth saying that most of the
ports i played (before 2019) had serious bugs and no one cares about it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Bug Reporting

It would help me if you find a problem and you report it to me but please check you
are reporting a REAL problem. I have been active on scmapdb and discord for long time,
i will read messages sent to me but i may not answer because i am tired of the bad side
of the community. Avoid making reports based only on resguy/w00tguy repacker script.
I check it frequently enough so i am sure the bug reports generated by these tools will
not be a problem. I notice some people are making this kind of reports without caring 
about real issues and i am starting to believe they are just trolling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Download site

For now i am using scmapdb.com to store my Sven Co-op maps/ports. This site has has been 
going downhill in the last years and is not a safe place for mappers to upload their 
maps since there are clear signs that the administrators may attempt to force random 
modifications over the maps hidden under the questionable "fixed" tag. Sadly this site 
has no alternative but i will try to find one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Survival

I do not support survival mode. The checkpoints are there but i cannot say if this
works correctly, i am not interested in this mode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Garompa fake fix

Since this is still generating confusion i will explain clearly.
The user Garompa uploaded a fake fixed version of echoes and made unnecessary, 
unauthorised changes to the page in the scmapdb site. I reverted the changes and told him
to not do vandalism there. Then, since i deleted the fake fixed version he starting 
discussing a valid way to upload it with a scmapbd administrator (Tunac) in the scmapdb 
discord without asking or caring about why i removed it in the first place. I Already
had a build up of annoyance from prior attemps from them to make me change stuff based on
ignorance and assumptions. With them i mean the user Garompa and the administrators 
Outerbeast and Tunac. These 3 have a arrogance problem. Also, they already forced changes
on others mappers projects. Example: "SA13" and "Last unic" even when the mapper rejected 
these changes. He wanted Last unic to not be uploaded to scmapdb but instead garompa 
modified and uploaded it to the site with support of the administrators. So, i decided to
make a stand agaist them and left "that message" on the echoes page. For now it looks like
they are holding off but who knows when they will strike again?

The details of the fake fix changes:

he added these 7 files:
player/playersounds/alyx_gordon01.wav
player/playersounds/alyx_hurt04.wav
player/playersounds/alyx_hurt05.wav
player/playersounds/alyx_hurt06.wav
player/playersounds/alyx_ohgod01.wav
player/playersounds/alyx_uggh01.wav
player/playersounds/alyx_uggh02.wav

he deleted these 2 files: 
weapons/xbow_reload1.ogg
barney/period.ogg

He added the corresponding .res changes.
He deleted the original author credits files.
He deleted and transfered to the echoes page the contents of my own credits file.
he did not modify any .bsp

about the Alyx sounds these are not used in the game. The Alyx model is used in echoes-14
(or former echoes24) and some unused sequences use these sounds. So they are not needed.
the xbow_reload1 is a extra file and it is ok to delete it. still, is worth saying that
an extra file will not change your game.
The barney sound is an duplicate file i added for convenience of mine. Deleting it will
not make a difference.

We can notice that these changes are made by poor, lazy use of resguy/W00tguy repacker 
script where he did not verify if there was a real problem.

In case it is not clear enough i will make a list of what is wrong here:
- he uploaded a "fixed version" without asking me about it, knowing i am an active user.
- he deleted credits files. This is the most basic thing you should not do.
- poor work using the w00tguy repacker script. 
- his "fixed version" does not solve any real problem. So, it is fake.
- he Uploaded a fake fixed version, treating mine as an inferior one, implying my version
has problems he solved.
- they attempted to force me to accept the fake fix.
- he is hiding the changes, not telling what are the bugs "fixed". 
- at no point they asked, or cared about why i did not wanted the "fixed version".
- Afterwards they backlashed with speaking garbage about me saying "kmkz do not fix bugs"
At no point they menction what are these bugs, also i have been fixing them ASAP when 
possible. Or garompa making up i have a prejudice against people because i am from 
Argentina.
