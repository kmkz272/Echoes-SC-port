1. Why/description
This is a full port/conversion of Echoes (Half-Life mod) to sven coop. After playing 
this awesome mod i started to make a port of it to be added to my server but shortly 
i stop working on it. Months later, after closing my servers i decided to resume the 
work and finish this, as a challenge. I aim to add as most of the content of the 
original mod as possible. You are free to report bugs or suggest changes if you want 
but bear in mind i am using months of my free time to do this as a hobby and for the 
challenge, not to satisfy the whims of users and server owners. Please avoid making
reports based only on a bspguy report, make sure there is a REAL problem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Important Notes 
echoes-6 may take a long while to load but it works, it is not a bug.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Changes made from the original mod
Some models and sounds were not included yet. I may add them in the future.
Some effects are missing or not fully implemented (custom env_shooter, custom env_sound)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Known issues 
-low fps in some maps: i did plenty to optimize the map, even if there is some stuff
that can be improved a bit the main problem is wpoly rising to very high values, i 
cannot do anything about that.
-echoes-5: in battle otis vs. bullsquid the bullsquid always win. This is because
if otis wins he gets bugged and stays still, i could not solve it yet.
-echoes-6: water is disconnected. This was caused when the maps were merged. Tried
many things to solve this but none worked so far. 
-echoes-10: the scientist does not open the door for bonus goods, i could not find
why the scientist is not detected by the trigger. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Quality Standars

I try to have the maps series without bugs and i have been maintaining and improving 
them in the last 6 years but is no easy task. Worth saying that most of the
ports i played (before 2019) had serious bugs and no one cares about it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Bug Reporting

It would help me if you find a problem and you report it to me but please check you
are reporting a REAL problem. I have been active on scmapdb and discord for long time,
i will read messages sent to me but i may not answer because i am tired of the bad side
of the community. Avoid making reports based only on resguy/w00tguy repacker script.
I check it frequently enough so i am sure the bug reports generated by these tools will
not be a problem. I notice some people are making this kind of reports without caring 
about real issues and i am starting to believe they are just trolling.

7. Download site

https://github.com/kmkz272/
https://gamebanana.com/mods/496418

I am using github to store my Sven Co-op ports and scripts since is far better than 
scmapdb, and so i am not using it anymore. This site has has been going downhill 
in the last years and is not a safe place for mappers to upload their maps since the 
incopetent administrators have been pushing and even forcing changes on other users 
maps based on their personal preferences, often making false reports in hope to gain 
some kind of legitimacy to push their changes as a way to feel they are somehow 
supporting the community since they are unwilling to keep themselves on their own 
projects and make their own maps. Please, do not upload this to scmapdb.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Survival

I do not support survival mode, i am not interested. Over the years there have been 
many signs from the devs that they are not willing to properly maintain this feature.

9. Garompa fake fix

Please be careful when you download a custom version. There are guy posing as experts,
making false bug reports and uploading fake fixes or shady/useless versions labeled as
"repacks,remaster,updated,..."

I will explain about this one:
The user Garompa uploaded a fake fixed version of echoes and made unnecessary, 
unauthorised changes to the page in the scmapdb site. I reverted the changes and told him
to not do vandalism there. Then, since i deleted the fake fixed version he starting 
discussing a valid way to upload it with a scmapbd administrator (Tunac) in the scmapdb 
discord without asking or caring about why i removed it in the first place. I Already
had a build up of annoyance from prior attemps from them to make me change stuff based on
ignorance and assumptions. With them i mean the user Garompa and the administrators 
Outerbeast and Tunac. These 3 have a arrogance problem. Also, they already forced changes
on others mappers projects. Example: "SA13" and "Last unic" even when the mapper rejected 
these changes. He wanted Last unic to not be uploaded to scmapdb but instead garompa 
modified and uploaded it to the site with support of the administrators. So, i decided to
make a stand agaist them and left "that message" on the echoes page. For now it looks like
they are holding off but who knows when they will strike again?

The details of the fake fix changes:

he added these 7 files:
player/playersounds/alyx_gordon01.wav
player/playersounds/alyx_hurt04.wav
player/playersounds/alyx_hurt05.wav
player/playersounds/alyx_hurt06.wav
player/playersounds/alyx_ohgod01.wav
player/playersounds/alyx_uggh01.wav
player/playersounds/alyx_uggh02.wav

he deleted these 2 files: 
weapons/xbow_reload1.ogg
barney/period.ogg

He added the corresponding .res changes.
He deleted the original author credits files.
He deleted and transfered to the echoes page the contents of my own credits file.
he did not modify any .bsp

about the Alyx sounds these are not used in the game. The Alyx model is used in echoes-14
(or former echoes24) and some unused sequences use these sounds. So they are not needed.
the xbow_reload1 is a extra file and it is ok to delete it. still, is worth saying that
an extra file will not change your game.
The barney sound is an duplicate file i added for convenience of mine. Deleting it will
not make a difference.

We can notice that these changes are made by poor, lazy use of resguy/W00tguy repacker 
script where he did not verify if there was a real problem.

In case it is not clear enough i will make a list of what is wrong here:
- he uploaded a "fixed version" without asking me about it, knowing i am an active user.
- he deleted credits files. This is the most basic thing you should not do.
- poor work using the w00tguy repacker script. 
- his "fixed version" does not solve any real problem. So, it is fake.
- he Uploaded a fake fixed version, treating mine as an inferior one, implying my version
has problems he solved.
- they attempted to force me to accept the fake fix.
- he is hiding the changes, not telling what are the bugs "fixed". 
- at no point they asked, or cared about why i did not wanted the "fixed version".
- Afterwards they backlashed with speaking garbage about me like "kmkz do not fix bugs"
At no point they menction what are these bugs, also i have been fixing them ASAP when 
possible. Or garompa making up i have a prejudice against people because i am from 
Argentina. 


About a newer one, "garompa repack version", is worthless as well. There is no explanation 
about what he changed but as far as i have seen he just edited the Alyx model and deleted 
the sounds paths from the model plus innecessary file changes like the explaned above.
So this repack is a useless edit that does not give anything good to the player,
just used to make a false claim that he "fixed" something.
